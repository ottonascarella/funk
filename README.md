# ðŸŽºðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¸ FUNK ðŸŽºðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¸

A ES6 library for funktional programming.

## Current Development State (just-for-funk, experimental)

## Intended Roadmap

* Complete tests
* Organise modules by CORE, LIST, MATH, LAMBDA (currently only CORE and LAMBDA)
* Write more-better tests
* Create a NPM repo for the project
* Write documentation (at least comment the code, really)

## Scripts

* `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode

##### This project was build using the [Webpack library starter](https://github.com/krasimir/webpack-library-starter)
